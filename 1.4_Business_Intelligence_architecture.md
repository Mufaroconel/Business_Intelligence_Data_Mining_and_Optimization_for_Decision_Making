# Business Intelligence System Architecture Overview

## Key Components of a BI System

### **Data Sources**
- **Origin:** Collects data from diverse primary and secondary sources including operational systems and external data providers.
- **Types:** Incorporates both structured data from operational systems and unstructured data such as emails.
- **Integration:** Requires significant efforts to unify and integrate these various data sources, a process detailed in Chapter 3.

### **Data Warehouses and Data Marts**
- **Storage:** Utilizes ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools to store data from different sources into databases designed to support BI analyses.
- **Function:** These databases, known as data warehouses and data marts, are central to organizing data for efficient BI processing.

### **Business Intelligence Methodologies**
- **Analysis Tools:** Data is processed using various BI methodologies to support decision-making, including:
  - Multidimensional cube analysis
  - Exploratory data analysis
  - Time series analysis
  - Inductive learning for data mining
  - Optimization models

## Process and Analysis Levels

### **Data Exploration**
- **Tools:** Involves query and reporting systems, and statistical methods.
- **Approach:** Often requires decision-makers to hypothesize or define data criteria beforehand, which are then explored to validate insights.

### **Data Mining**
- **Active BI Methodologies:** Focuses on extracting information and knowledge without pre-defined hypotheses, using pattern recognition and machine learning techniques.

### **Optimization**
- **Goal:** Identifies the best solutions from a set of possible actions, enhancing decision-making in fields such as marketing and logistics.

### **Decisions**
- **Final Step:** Represents the culmination of the BI process where decisions are made based on the insights derived from the BI methodologies.

## Conclusion

From data collection to decision-making, the BI system architecture described illustrates a layered approach where each component plays a crucial role in transforming raw data into actionable insights, supporting complex decision-making across various departments of an organization.
