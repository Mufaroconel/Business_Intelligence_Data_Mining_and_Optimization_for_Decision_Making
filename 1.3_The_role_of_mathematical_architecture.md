# Role of Mathematical Models in Business Intelligence

## Overview

Mathematical models and algorithms are crucial in Business Intelligence systems for extracting useful information and knowledge from data. These models range from simple calculations, such as totals and percentages displayed in histograms, to more complex optimization and learning models.

## Purpose and Application

- **Simplification:** Even basic tools like spreadsheets, which may simulate financial scenarios affected by interest rate changes, help decision-makers conceptualize financial processes.
- **Scientific Approach:** Traditionally used in disciplines like physics, mathematical models abstractly represent real systems. In BI, these models help manage and analyze systems within organizations, promoting a scientific and rational management approach.
  
## Process in Business Intelligence Analysis

1. **Objective Identification:** Goals of the analysis are set and performance indicators are established to evaluate different scenarios.
2. **Model Development:** Models are crafted by defining relationships among system variables, parameters, and metrics.
3. **What-if Analysis:** These models are then used to simulate different scenarios to understand potential impacts on system performance due to variable or parameter changes.

## Benefits of Using Mathematical Models

- **Enhanced Decision-Making:** The primary benefit is improving the effectiveness of decision processes.
- **Deeper Understanding:** Developing abstract models requires focusing on key domain features, leading to a deeper understanding of the subject matter.
- **Knowledge Transfer:** The insights and knowledge gained from building models can be more easily shared within the organization, enhancing knowledge retention.
- **Flexibility and Reusability:** Models designed for specific tasks are often general enough to be applicable to similar issues in the future, adding long-term value.

## Conclusion

Mathematical models are integral to enhancing the rationality and effectiveness of decision-making in Business Intelligence. They not only facilitate a more scientific approach to business management but also support the preservation and transfer of organizational knowledge.
